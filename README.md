## How to Start
The initial page loads the computational time for the GoalOriented Robot and Optimised Robot averaged over 100 iterations.
This is followed by the testing code for the design of Persistent Group.
## Excercises Solved
* Design a function to compare the performance of 2 robots for 100 iterations.
* Design a robot with an algorithm that surpasses the running time of GoalOriented Robot.
* Design a Persistent Group.
